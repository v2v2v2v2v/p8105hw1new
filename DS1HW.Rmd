penguins
plot(penguins$bill_length_mm,penguins$flipper_length_mm)

Short description: species, sex and island are factors, bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are
doubles while flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, year are integers.
The dataset penguins has 344 rows and 8 columns i.e. 344x8 size. The mean flipper length is 200.9

```{R}
q2 = rnorm(10)
d = q2>0
d
char_vec = c("H","H","H","H","H","H","H","H","H","H")
length(char_vec)
g=c("M", "M", "M", "M", "T", "F", "F", "F", "F", "F")
gen=as.factor(g)
gen
dfhw = data.frame(q2, d, char_vec, gen)
dfhw
library(tidyverse)
mean(pull(dfhw, q2))
mean(pull(dfhw, d))
mean(pull(dfhw, char_vec))
mean(pull(dfhw, gen))
#The factor and character vector used here do not give a mean.
#However, q2 (random normal sample vector) and d (logical vector) do give a mean
